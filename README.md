# Self-Driving Car AI 🚗🧠

This project uses Behavioral Cloning to train a Convolutional Neural Network that can autonomously drive a car in a simulator.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `model.py`: Training script
- `drive.py`: Script to run the car in autonomous mode
- `model/model.h5`: Trained Keras model
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder containing training images and driving logs

## 📹 Demo
[Insert link to a YouTube demo or GIF of the car driving, if available]

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras / TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Udacity simulator
4. Run the car:  
```bash
python model/drive.py
